* Walking until my legs give out, with no particular destination in mind.
* Dwelling on impossible possibilities just for the sake of it.
* Looking for new bakeries.
* Carefully examining the ceiling.
* philosophizing about right and wrong.
* dehydrating.
* Playing hide-and-seek with tasks I have at hand.
